# What this workflow should acheive:

## Build the GCC compiler (and things) under ubuntu, but only when they change.
 - upload a deb package with this?
 - generate upload a docker container?
## Build the lib (dragon) under ubuntu always, but use the latest GCC compiler.
 - upload a deb package with this?
 - generate upload a docker container?

## Build the test ROM
- Build the test ROM, but always use the latest GCC compiler, and chained lib (dragon).

### Build a Windows compatible toolchain binary (MSYS2??) since everything else has completed?!
